## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend Security Middleware Resolution

**File**: `backend/src/middleware/security.ts`

- **Issue**: Duplicate helmet CSP configurations causing meta tag injection
- **Fix**: Disabled helmet CSP, implemented custom HTTP-header middleware
- **Result**: Clean CSP delivery without meta tag violations

### 2. Square Domain Whitelisting

**CSP Policy**: Script-src directive updated to include:

- `https://js.squareup.com`
- `https://connect.squareup.com`
- `https://web.squarecdn.com`
- `https://sandbox.web.squarecdn.com`

### 3. Server Configuration Updates

**File**: `backend/src/server.ts`

- **Issue**: Conflicting security middleware initialization
- **Fix**: Consolidated security middleware application
- **Result**: Single, consistent CSP policy deployment
