## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
VITE_LITEAPI_KEY=your_liteapi_key
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_square_access_token
SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=your_square_app_id
SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox

# Optional simulated PayPal (no real API calls yet)
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=placeholder
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=placeholder
PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
```

## API Integration

The frontend connects to the modern TypeScript backend in `backend/` which provides:

- Hotel search via LiteAPI
- OpenAI natural language processing
- Booking management
- Payment processing

### Payment Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | /api/payments/create | Create & capture Square payment (sourceId nonce) |
| POST | /api/payments/paypal/order | Create simulated PayPal order (records pending payment) |
| POST | /api/payments/paypal/capture | Capture simulated PayPal order (marks succeeded) |
| GET | /api/payments/booking/:id | List payments & refunds for booking |
| POST | /api/payments/refund | Create Square refund |
| GET | /api/payments/history | Paginated user payment history |
| GET | /api/payments/stats | Basic revenue stats |

Notes:

- Idempotent booking payments: second succeeded attempt returns existing record.
- Booking auto-confirm only when payment status transitions to succeeded.
- Square webhook endpoint at `/api/payments/webhook/square` expects raw body (configure in Square dashboard).
- Legacy Stripe code replaced with inert stubs and safe to remove later.
