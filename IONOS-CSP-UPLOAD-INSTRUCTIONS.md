# 🚀 IONOS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT - CSP FIXES

CRITICAL: These files contain the CSP fixes that resolve Square payment blocking

📁 STEP 1: FRONTEND FILES (5 minutes)

1. Navigate to your IONOS File Manager
2. Upload ALL files from the dist/ folder:
   - assets
   - icon-72.png
   - icon.svg
   - index.html
   - manifest.json
   - sw.js
3. Replace existing files (this updates the frontend with CSP fixes)

🔧 STEP 2: BACKEND SECURITY (3 minutes)

1. Upload production-security-middleware.js to your server
2. Update your server.js to import and use this middleware:

   const { securityMiddleware } = require('./production-security-middleware.js');
   app.use(securityMiddleware);

3. Restart your server/application

🧪 STEP 3: VERIFICATION (2 minutes)

1. Visit vibehotelbookings.com
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Navigate to booking page
4. Verify: NO errors like "Refused to load https://web.squarecdn.com"
5. Confirm: Square payment form loads without CSP violations

📊 EXPECTED RESULTS:
✅ Square SDK loads successfully
✅ Payment forms display properly  
✅ No CSP blocking errors in console
✅ Live payment processing active

⚠️ NOTES:

- You may still see "report-only" CSP warnings - these are harmless
- Meta tag warnings don't affect functionality - only blocking errors matter
- Square SDK should show as available in browser console

🎯 SUCCESS INDICATOR:
Square payment form loads and functions without console errors blocking external resources.
